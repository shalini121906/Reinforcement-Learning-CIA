Media companies want to increase views on certain "aligned" articles that are politically or commercially important. The challenge is to promote these articles effectively while also finding other articles that might attract high views.


K-arm Bandit

- Arms: Each arm represents an article that can be promoted.

- Rewards: The reward for promoting an article is the number of views it gets. Views on aligned articles are given more importance.

- Exploration vs. Exploitation:

- Exploration: Try promoting different articles to see which ones do well.

- Exploitation: Focus on articles that are already getting a lot of views, especially the aligned ones.


Strategies

- Epsilon-Greedy: Sometimes promote a random article (exploration), but usually promote the best-performing ones (exploitation).

- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): Promote articles that have high potential, even if they havenâ€™t been promoted much yet.

- Thompson Sampling: Use a probability-based approach to pick the articles that are most likely to get high views.


Implementation Steps

1. Data Collection: Track how many views different articles are getting.

2. Model Setup: Set up the system with different articles (arms) and choose an initial strategy (like epsilon-greedy).

3. Learning Phase: As more data comes in, adjust which articles are promoted based on their performance.

4. Evaluation: Keep an eye on how well aligned articles are doing compared to others and adjust the strategy if needed.

5. Optimization: Fine-tune the system to better promote aligned articles.
