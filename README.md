# 1. Media companies want to increase views on certain "aligned" articles that are politically or commercially important. The challenge is to promote these articles effectively while also finding other articles that might attract high views.


K-arm Bandit

- Arms: Each arm represents an article that can be promoted.

- Rewards: The reward for promoting an article is the number of views it gets. Views on aligned articles are given more importance.

- Exploration vs. Exploitation:

- Exploration: Try promoting different articles to see which ones do well.

- Exploitation: Focus on articles that are already getting a lot of views, especially the aligned ones.


Strategies

- Epsilon-Greedy: Sometimes promote a random article (exploration), but usually promote the best-performing ones (exploitation).

- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): Promote articles that have high potential, even if they havenâ€™t been promoted much yet.

- Thompson Sampling: Use a probability-based approach to pick the articles that are most likely to get high views.


Implementation Steps

1. Data Collection: Track how many views different articles are getting.

2. Model Setup: Set up the system with different articles (arms) and choose an initial strategy (like epsilon-greedy).

3. Learning Phase: As more data comes in, adjust which articles are promoted based on their performance.

4. Evaluation: Keep an eye on how well aligned articles are doing compared to others and adjust the strategy if needed.

5. Optimization: Fine-tune the system to better promote aligned articles.

# 2. MDP-based RL agent
Creating a 100x100 grid with obstacles and then building an MDP-based RL agent to optimize policies and actions involves several steps. Below is a high-level outline of how you can approach this problem, including the implementation of a Dynamic Programming (DP) method and other RL solutions for benchmarking.

Step 1: Define the Grid Environment
Grid Initialization: Create a 100x100 grid.

- Obstacles Placement: Randomly place obstacles in the grid.

- Start and Goal Points: Randomly select two points as the start and goal.

Step 2: Define the MDP Components
- States: Each cell in the grid is a state.

- Actions: Define actions as movements (up, down, left, right, diagonal).

- Transition Probabilities: Define deterministic transitions (e.g., moving from one cell to another).

- Rewards: Assign rewards based on the state transitions (e.g., -1 for each step, +100 for reaching the goal, -100 for hitting an obstacle).

Step 3: Implement Dynamic Programming (DP)
Value Iteration:

- Initialize the value function for all states.

- Iterate until convergence:

- Update the value function using the Bellman equation.

- Extract the optimal policy from the value function.

Policy Iteration:

- Initialize a random policy.

- Iterate until convergence:

- Policy Evaluation: Compute the value function for the current policy.

- Policy Improvement: Update the policy based on the value function.

Step 4: Implement Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithms
Q-Learning:

- Initialize the Q-table.

- Iterate through episodes:

- Choose an action using an epsilon-greedy policy.

= Update the Q-value using the Q-learning update rule.

SARSA:

- Initialize the Q-table.

- Iterate through episodes:

- Choose an action using an epsilon-greedy policy.

- Update the Q-value using the SARSA update rule.

Deep Q-Network (DQN):

- Use a neural network to approximate the Q-function.

- Implement experience replay and target networks.

- Train the network using the DQN update rule.

Step 5: Benchmarking
Performance Metrics:

- Number of steps to reach the goal.

- Cumulative reward.

- Convergence time.

Comparison:

- Compare the performance of DP methods (Value Iteration, Policy Iteration) with RL methods (Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN).

- Plot the results to visualize the differences.
